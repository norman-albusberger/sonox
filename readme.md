SonoX integrates Sonos (especially the S1 version.) speakers with your Loxone Smart Home system for seamless control and automation. The plugin provides a web interface for testing commands and copying URLs for Loxone outputs. You can control playback, adjust volume, and manage groups across rooms. SonoX also supports text-to-speech (TTS) and audio clips for announcements and notifications. The plugin publishes Sonos events to MQTT topics for further integration with your smart home system.
